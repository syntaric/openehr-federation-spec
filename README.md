# Proposal for Federation Tier with AQL

A specification for a **Federation Tier** in openEHR querying: it lets a client run an
AQL query across **multiple distributed CDRs** as though they were a single repository.
The federation is keyed on each node's **local `ehr_id`** - patient identity is resolved
*outside* AQL (proposed binding: IHE PIXm/XCPD/mCSD, with the Dutch Generic Functions as
a regional alternative), and each node then receives **standard, non-federated AQL**
scoped to its resolved `ehr_id`. The gateway is a transparent façade: a client never
needs federation-specific syntax to run a basic patient query.

> **Status: working draft, v0.4.0.** This is very much a work in progress, circulated by
> the openEHR Federation Working Group for comment. Feedback of every kind is welcome —
> from typo fixes to fundamental disagreement with the model. See
> [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Rendered site

The spec is published with [Antora](https://antora.org/) via GitHub Pages:

**https://syntaric.github.io/openehr-federation-spec/**

## Building locally

Requires Node.js (18+), GNU Make, and Python 3 (for the preview server).

```sh
make
```

That builds the site and serves it at http://localhost:8080/. Use another port
with `make PORT=9000`.

Individual targets:

| Target | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make` | `build` then `serve` - the usual one-liner |
| `make build` | Build the site into `build/site` |
| `make serve` | Serve an already-built site (fails if there is no build) |
| `make clean` | Remove `build/` |

`npm install` runs automatically when `package-lock.json` is newer than
`node_modules`, so there is no separate install step.

Prefer npm directly? `npm install && npm run build` does the same build; the
Makefile just adds the server. Opening `build/site/index.html` as a `file://`
URL mostly works, but the search box needs HTTP - use `make serve` for that.

Antora builds the local working tree, so uncommitted edits to the `.adoc`
sources do appear in the output.

## Repository layout

```
antora.yml                    Antora component descriptor (component: federation-aql, v0.4)
antora-playbook.yml           Antora playbook (local build and CI use the same one)
Makefile                      Local build and preview server (make, make build, make serve)
modules/ROOT/pages/           The specification, one AsciiDoc page per section - this is
                              the source of truth; edit these
modules/ROOT/images/          Rendered diagrams (PNG)
modules/ROOT/nav.adoc         Site navigation
diagrams/                     PlantUML sources for the diagrams
.github/workflows/publish.yml Builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages on push to main
```
