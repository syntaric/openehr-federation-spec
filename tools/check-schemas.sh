# Validate the specification's own JSON examples against the JSON Schemas it
# publishes.
#
# This is what makes the schemas load-bearing rather than decorative. Without
# it, modules/ROOT/attachments/*.schema.json is a third human-readable artifact
# that can disagree with the example beside it — which is exactly the defect
# that shipped in 0.3.1, where §9's example serialised `rows` as objects while
# the ITS-REST RESULT_SET it claimed conformance to defines them as arrays.
# That defect is mechanically detectable, and this script is what detects it.
#
# Strategy: extract each `[source,json]` block from the page, validate it
# against the schema that governs that page's structure. Only blocks that *are*
# a whole envelope / whole OPTIONS body are checked; fragments illustrating one
# field are skipped by the heuristic below and named in the output, so a
# silently-unchecked block is visible rather than invisible.
#
# Usage:  tools/check-schemas.sh
# Exits non-zero on the first schema failure; prints one line per block.
