# Resolve every *prose* section reference in the spec against the headings that

# Antora already fails the build on a broken `xref:` macro (antora-playbook.yml
# runs with failure_level: warn). Nothing checks a bare prose reference like
# "§27" or "§B.7", nor a §number that appears only in an xref's *link text* —
# which is exactly why four such defects shipped in v0.3. This script is the
# missing half of that gate; run it before opening a PR (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
#
# Emits one line per unresolved reference and exits non-zero if any are found.
#
# Originally written for the UNIO implementation review of v0.3 and vendored
# here so the check runs in this repository's CI.
